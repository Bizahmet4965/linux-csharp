Hi guys

today i will show you how to write c# programming language in linux

first we need to download visual studio code

do i need to download dotnet later

after downloading both, we enter visual studio code

Visual studio code also add-ons C# , C# Namespace Autocompletion , C# Extensions , C# Colors and Auto-Using for C#
we install

then we create a new folder, don't forget the file program, this will be the folder where you will write the code


then we need to open a new terminal, press the 7th from the top left, press new terminal and create a new terminal

we write "dotnet new console" in the terminal, here it creates the files to write c#

After typing that much c#, we come to the terminal and write "dotnet run" and that's it.
